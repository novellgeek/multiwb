# multiwb

Requirements
Python 3.x
pip install PyQt5
Windows OS (for multiple monitor enumeration)
How it works:

Each monitor has its own layout preset ("Custom", "Vertical", "Horizontal 1v2h (1 vertical and 2 horizontal)", "2x2 Grid") in the grid settings.
Zoom and URL can be edited for each web window.
Double-click a URL to edit it.
The configuration can be saved and loaded.
Let me know if you want further tweaks or enhancements!

requires launch_windows_runner.py in the same folder as multimonitor-final


If you apply the above changes, the region selector will always appear when you assign a URL to a monitor set to 1V2H and will update live as you change assignments or presets.
