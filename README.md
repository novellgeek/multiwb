Requirements

How it works:

Each monitor has its own layout preset ("Custom", "Vertical", "Horizontal", "2x2 Grid") in the grid settings.
Zoom and URL can be edited for each web window.
Double-click a URL to edit it.
The config can be saved/loaded.
Let me know if you want further tweaks or enhancements!
